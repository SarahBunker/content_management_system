1. When a user visits the path "/", the application should display the text "Getting started."
What: displaying "Getting started." from the url path "/"
How: create a route to "/" using GET method.

2. When a user visits the home page, they should see a list of the documents in the CMS: history.txt, changes.txt and about.txt
other information: Each document within the CMS will have a name that includes an extension. This extension will determine how the contents of the page are displayed in later steps.
What: Home page shows a list of documents. Document name includes an extension that will be used later. Documents are sorted alphabetically. Documents are shown in an unordered list format.
How:
- view pages have .erb extension

- yield to view page in the body
- create a view page for the index page
- in the view page create an unordered list and itterate through items in documents to print out their names.
- define the before method
  - create a key in the session object called documents.
  - For now add a value that is an array with three items in the array. with text values of the known document names.
- in the home path define an instance variable for the documents
  - sort the documents
- tell page to load the view with the layout


Likely do later
